				<b style="font-size: 2.9em; float: left; margin-top: -7px; margin-bottom: -14px;">Y</b>ou are a lanista in ancient Rome, attempting to raise the status of your ludis by winning gladiatorial competitions.
				To win competitions, you need a good balance of gladiators that are Strong, Dexterous, and Intelligent.
				Each competition will test a different combinations of skills.
			</p>
		</div><div class="row">
			<p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
				The game takes place over 2 phases, each with 6 rounds.
				In phase 1, you bid on lots of slaves, each lot contains one slave per player.
				Winning a bid will grant you first choice of slave from that lot.
				If you drop out of a bid, you will get half (rounded down) of your money back and are still able to select a slave before players who have passed before you.
			</p>
		</div><div class="row">
			<p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
				Once you have amassed 6 slaves, the games can begin (Phase 2).
				Each round in the second phase represents a competition.
				The competition type is listed at the top of the playing area, and it will dictate the character traits required to be successful this round (eg: Str * Dex indicates that your gladiator's strength will be multiplied by his dexterity. Largest number wins).
				Winning a competition grants you the largest prize from the pool, second best takes second-best prize and so on.

				The lanista with the most money at the end of the two rounds is declared the winner!
